### Agile Methodology

We utilized the Agile Methodology to effectively prioritize and organize tasks, including the creation of user stories and the utilization of Project Boards on GitHub. Additionally, a template was developed to streamline the process of crafting user stories.

* We drafted epics containing potential user stories, serving as the foundation for developing the website.
* User stories were derived from the epics and refined through iterative processes, driving the project forward.
* The Project Board is publicly accessible, providing transparency and insight into the project's progress.
* Utilizing the Project Board, tasks were tracked as they moved through the stages of Todo, In Progress, and Done.
* Labels were incorporated to categorize issues based on their level of importance, aiding in prioritization and organization.
